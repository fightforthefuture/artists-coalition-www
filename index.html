        Don't censor the web in our names.

    <h3>
        As artists who make work on, for, and by the Internet, our livelihoods are under threat. Extreme enforcement of copyright kills our creativity. Censorship limits our freedom of expression. Together we pledge to find ways to protect the Internet we love.

Sometimes we use copyright to make a living. But too much copyright enforcement threatens to censor the Internet we love. And it's already gone too far. <strong>Don't censor the web in our names.</strong>
